# GeyserMC compatibility
**There should be a tutorial, how to set-up Geyser**  
*maybe later*


## Warnings!

Emotecraft has a pretty complex logic to play emotes for people joining after the emote play started.  
BE has nothing to do with it. Don't make long emotes for Bedrock users.  
  
Also BE can not stop an emote.
