`emote_creator.blend` and `emote_creator_bend.blend` are project for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)   
bend can create emotes containing bending, but it's a bit more complicated to use.    
To use these, use the 2.83 LTS, or the latest version of Blender.  
[Emotecraft wiki](https://kosmx.gitbook.io/emotecraft/tutorial/custom-emotes) if you're stuck.

`model.bbmodel` is a model for [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net/) You can use this as well.  
To use it, you'll need to install [GeckoLib](https://geckolib.com/) plugin first.
